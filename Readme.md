# PodigeeEmbedKitDemo

This is a small iOS demo project showcasing the usage of [PodigeeEmbedKit](https://github.com/podigee/PodigeeEmbedKit/). You can find the complete framework documentation there.

The `AVPlayer` usage and implementation in this demo is very basic and not recommended to be used like this in a real world app. This demo project focuses on the usage of the `PodigeeEmbedKit` framework. Documentation on how to use `AVPlayer` to play audio can be found in Apple's docs.
